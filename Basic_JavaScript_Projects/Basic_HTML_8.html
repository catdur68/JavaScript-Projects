    <h1>Concatenate</h1>
    <p>Assembles several string variables into 1
        string variable. Ex: "Hello" + "World" = "Hello World".
        Useful when reconstructing addresses pulled
        from a database. Here the sentence (the new variable)
        is made of 4 separate string variables.
        <button onclick="sentence()">click me</button>
        <p id="assembled"></p>
    </p>

    <h1>Slice</h1>
    <p>This method retrieves into a new variable the character(s)
        contained between 2 positions in the string. The number given
        for the first position is the one preceding the start 
        of what you are looking for. In this example, the word
        "unfairness" starts in position 25 in the string, and
        we ask the method to look after 24. 
        <button onclick="slice()">One Key-Word</button>
        <p id="oneWord"></p>
    </p>
    <h1>Convert to Upper case</h1>
    <p>that is the key-word:
        <p id="convert">
        <script>to_majuscule()</script>
        </p>

    </p>
    <h1>Search for something in a string (case insensitive)</h1>
    <p>if it finds something it returns a number which 
        indicates where the position in the string it found it. 
        If not found, returns -1 (like "negative, not found"). This 
        could be useful when you want to slice a section of 
        a string. You would first determine if something exists
        in the string (search) and then take that section
        The variable in this example is: "the only Arab countries
        and make it a new variable.
        with normal ties with Israel." The method var.search()
         is looking for the word "israel", not case sensitive. 
        This word is found in position 46. 
         <p id="trouve"></p>    
    <p><script>mySearch()</script></p>
    </p>

    <h1>Convert a number to string</h1>
    <p>the string Method (toString())
    <p id="Numb_to_string">Convert # 100 to "100"</p>
    <button onclick="convertNumb()">Click me</button>
    </p>

    <h1>the toPrecision Method</h1>
    <p>Keeping as many decimals as you need. Here we keep 5 
        decimals for the pi number. Warning: the method regards
        the period as a decimal, so we instruct 6 to obtain
        5 decimals.
        <p id="precisely">Keeps 5 decimals from pi = 3.14159265359</p>
    <button onclick="Keep_decimals()">Click me</button>
    </p>

    <h1>Converting a number with decimals to string</h1>
    <p>here we round pi to 2 decimals and convert to string with the toFixed() Method.
    Warning: unlike the toPrecision method, if we want 2 decimals, we put
    2 as parameter.
        <p id="numb_Rd_str">Keeps 2 decimals from pi = 3.14159265359, and converts to string</p>
        <button onclick="mytoFixed()">Click me</button>
    </p>

    <h1>The value of</h1>
    <p>Basically returns the PRIMITIVE value contained in the string.
        Not sure in which context this would be more helpful
        than typing the value directly in HTML.
        <button onclick="primitive()">Click here</button>
        <p id="val"></p>
    </p>
